// Question: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.

// let num = 1;
// while (num <= 5) {
//   console.log(num);
//   num++;
// }

// Question: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a do while loop.

// let index = 1;
// do {
//   console.log(index);
//   index++;
// } while (index < 5);

let counter = 0;
while (counter < 5) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter++;
}

// One key difference between a do...while loop and a while loop is that the do...while loop will execute the block of code at least once before checking the condition.

// If the condition is true, the block of code will continue to execute. If the condition is false, the block of code will stop executing.

let raka = 5;
do {
  raka++;
  console.log(raka);
} while (raka < 2);

let aka = 5;
while (aka < 2) {
  aka++;
  console.log(aka);
}
